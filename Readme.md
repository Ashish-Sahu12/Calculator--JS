This JavaScript calculator project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations directly in their web browser. The code listens for button clicks and updates the input field accordingly. Key features include:

1. Evaluation of expressions using the eval function when the "=" button is pressed, with error handling for invalid inputs.

2. Clearing the input using the "AC" button.

3. Deleting the last character using the "DEL" button.

4. Appending button values to the current input for building expressions.

This code provides a straightforward way to create a functional and user-friendly calculator interface.
